# Problem Set #1

# Installing Python and IDLE
Follow the steps in [Getting Python](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Getting_Python) for installing Python and IDLE onto the machine you plan to be
using this term.

Familiarize yourself with Python and IDLE using the exercises given in the handout. Once you are
ready, proceed to the programming part of this assignment.

Note, when you first start using your system, make sure that the version number displayed is not 3.0 or
higher. That version of Python is not backwards compatible with 2.7.16, which is the official Python
version used in this course.

## A Very Simple Program: Entering and Printing Your Name
The goal of this programming exercise is simply to get you more comfortable with using IDLE, and to
begin using simple elements of Python. Standard elements of a program include the ability to print out
results (using the `print` operation), the ability to read input from a user at the console (for example using
the `raw_input` or `input` function), and the ability to store values in a variable, so that the program can
access that value as needed.

## Problem 1
Write a program that does the following in order:
- Asks the user to enter his/her date of birth.
- Asks the user to enter his/her last name.
- Prints out the user’s last name and date of birth, in that order.

An example of an interaction with your program is shown below (the words printed in bold are user's inputs, based on your commands, the words in regular font are from the computer – the difference
helps you distinguish the two components):

Enter your date of birth:
**01/26/32**

Enter your last name:
**Grimson**

Grimson 01/26/32

### Hints:
To see how to use the `print` command, you may find it convenient to look at the [input and output section
of the Python Wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Input_and_output). This will show you how to use `print` statements to print out values of strings.
To see how to read input from a user’s console into the Python environment, you may find it convenient
to look at the same section (see for example the `raw_input` or `input` function).
Remember that if you want to hold onto a value, you need to store it in a variable (i.e., give it a name to
which you can refer when you want that value). You may find it convenient to look at the [variables and
strings](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Variables_and_Strings) section of the Python Wikibook.
